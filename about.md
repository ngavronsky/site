## What I Do

Nick has been a pivotal part of the tech community in NYC as a 2x founder who has helped build leading product teams and experiences in consumer and enterprise tech. Nick is currently the CEO & Co-Founder of [Welcome](https://www.heywelcome.com), which was acquired by [BambooHR](https:www.bamboohr.com) in August 2022–where he and the Welcome team are continuing their mission to reimagine compensation. 

Prior to founding Welcome, Nick was a Co-Founder & Chief Product Officer at [Trade](https://www.drinktrade.com), helping scale the business to tens of thousands of subscribers and tens of millions in revenue. He previously served as the Director of Product at [Slice](https://slicelife.com), building a marketplace experience and brand for millions of consumers and thousands of restaurant partners, scaling the business to over $100MM in GMV. Nick was an early employee and Sr. Product Manager at [Betterment](https://www.betterment.com), where he managed web and mobile experiences, built new product lines for financial advisors and employers, and led the growth team, helping take the business to over $7Bn in assets under management. Prior to that, Nick led Product at [OpenFin](https://wwww.openfin.co), building the financial industry’s first common operating system which is now deployed on over 200,000 financial desktops. Nick started his career at [Citi](https://www.citi.com) as a Product Manager and Financial Analyst, working on the bank’s payments products.

When he’s not building and designing products, Nick can be found spending time with his wife and kids, golfing, playing video games, or watching Formula 1.
