## What I Do

Nick has been a pivotal part of the tech community in NYC, helping build leading product teams and experiences in consumer and enterprise tech. As a co-founder and Head of Product at [Trade](https://www.drinktrade.com), Nick leads the development of the brand’s vision, product strategy, and experience for customers and roasters–all built around a deeply personalized subscription experience, which has scaled to tens of thousands of subscribers and millions in revenue.

He previously served as the Director of Product at [Slice](https://slicelife.com), building a marketplace experience and brand for millions of consumers and thousands of restaurant partners, scaling the business from $30MM to over $100MM in GMV. Nick was an early employee and Sr. Product Manager at [Betterment](https://www.betterment.com), where he managed web and mobile experiences, built new product lines for financial advisors and employers, and led the growth team, helping take the business from $100MM to over $7Bn in AUM. Prior to that, Nick led Product at [OpenFin](https://wwww.openfin.co), building the financial industry’s first common operating system which is now deployed on over 200,000 financial desktops. 

Nick started his career at [Citi](https://www.citi.com) as a Product Manager and Financial Analyst, working on the bank’s payments products.

When he’s not building and designing products, Nick can be found hanging out in Brooklyn with his wife, Michelle, and his son, Noah.
