[Betterment](https://www.betterment.com) is the largest independent online financial advisor that serves one purpose: to help you make the most of your money. Betterment takes Nobel Prize - winning investment strategies and combining them with cutting edge, tax smart investing technology to maximize take home returns for hundreds of thousands of customers across our three business lines: direct-to-consumer, Betterment for Advisors, and Betterment for Business.  

I joined Betterment as an early employee and first PM, building products that helped scale assets under management to over $7Bn. In addition to managing the core comnsumer web experience, I was responsible for leading and building the mobile team and strategy (iOS, Android), bringing Betterment's first mobile apps to market.

Spearheaded our efforts to enter new lines of business and build new product lines: [Betterment Institutional](https://www.bettermentforadvisors.com) (for financial advisors) and [Betterment for Business](https://www.bettermentforbusiness.com) (401(k) for employers). I developed the vision, business plan, and roadmap for both business lines and lead large engineering and design teams to bring the products to life.
