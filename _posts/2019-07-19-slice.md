[Slice](https://www.slicelife.com) is on a mission to create the most valuable pizza brand on the planet. They connect makers and eaters to enrich their lives through the power of specialization and pizza expertise. Backed by generations of knowledge and cutting-edge technology, Slice gives makers the platform and voice to take charge of their industry, expand their coverage, and fill the world with authentic cuisine. Slice serves over 10,000 independent restaurants and millions of consumers every day!

As Director of Product, I joined Slice early while it was as MyPizza.com, overseeing the product team and setting the vision and strategy for our consumer and restaurant product experiences. Rebuilt the entire experience as part of the Slice rebrand and introduced Slice's first mobile apps, which drove tremendous growth and scale. Slice quickly rose to the top 30 in the food category of the App Store, and was featured several times by Apple.
